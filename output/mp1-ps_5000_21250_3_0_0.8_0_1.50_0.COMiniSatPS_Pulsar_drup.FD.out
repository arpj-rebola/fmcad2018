s REJECTED
Detected an incorrect instruction at instruction 1131748.
Introduced clause C: -2347 -77 13 0
The folowing literals were derived by unit propagation on ~C without reaching a conflict:
-4088 -3098 -50 -38 -26 -13 -11 -9 -7 -6 1 2 16 77 89 2347 4079 
C was thus decided not to be a RUP clause in the accumulated formula.
Furthermore, the following clause D was found in the accumulated formula:
2347 -164 -22 0
C and D are resolvable upon literal -2347.
The folowing literals were derived by unit propagation on ~(C \/ D \ {2347} without reaching a conflict:
-4088 -3098 -1824 -50 -38 -26 -13 -11 -9 -7 -6 1 2 16 22 77 89 164 2347 2749 3464 4079 
C was thus decided not to be a RAT clause in the accumulated formula upon the pivot -2347 which first occurred in C in the input DRAT proof.
