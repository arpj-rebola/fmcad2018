s REJECTED
Detected an incorrect instruction at instruction 1085789.
Introduced clause C: 1844 16 68 0
The folowing literals were derived by unit propagation on ~C without reaching a conflict:
-1844 -1236 -68 -16 -13 -10 -7 -5 -4 -3 -1 2 6 11 26 72 976 1000 2526 4871 
C was thus decided not to be a RUP clause in the accumulated formula.
Furthermore, the following clause D was found in the accumulated formula:
-585 -1844 -1675 0
C and D are resolvable upon literal 1844.
The folowing literals were derived by unit propagation on ~(C \/ D \ {-1844} without reaching a conflict:
-1844 -1236 -68 -16 -13 -10 -7 -5 -4 -3 -1 2 6 11 26 72 585 976 1000 1675 2526 4871 
C was thus decided not to be a RAT clause in the accumulated formula upon the pivot 1844 which first occurred in C in the input DRAT proof.
