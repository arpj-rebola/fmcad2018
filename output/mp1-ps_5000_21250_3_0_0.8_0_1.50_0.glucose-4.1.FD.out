Detected an incorrect instruction at instruction 1398065.
Introduced clause C: 0
The folowing literals were derived by unit propagation on ~C without reaching a conflict:
-4996 -2905 -2486 -1815 -1186 -873 -675 -605 -38 -13 -12 -11 -10 -8 -4 -2 -1 5 6 15 16 35 43 47 946 1249 1424 1694 2121 3018 3659 3894 
C was thus decided not to be a RUP clause in the accumulated formula.
Furthermore, C is the empty clause, so C cannot be a RAT.
