Detected an incorrect instruction at instruction 1775001.
Introduced clause C: 96 0
The folowing literals were derived by unit propagation on ~C without reaching a conflict:
-176 -163 -159 -156 -147 -145 -116 -97 -96 -94 -90 -78 -64 -60 -53 -51 -48 -45 -40 -36 -28 -21 -10 -8 3 5 11 20 46 47 50 83 98 117 124 137 152 154 
C was thus decided not to be a RUP clause in the accumulated formula.
Furthermore, the following clause D was found in the accumulated formula:
63 -96 64 0
C and D are resolvable upon literal 96.
The folowing literals were derived by unit propagation on ~(C \/ D \ {-96} without reaching a conflict:
-176 -163 -159 -156 -147 -145 -116 -97 -96 -94 -90 -78 -64 -63 -60 -53 -51 -48 -45 -40 -36 -28 -21 -10 -8 3 5 11 20 46 47 50 83 98 117 124 137 152 154 
C was thus decided not to be a RAT clause in the accumulated formula upon the pivot 96 which first occurred in C in the input DRAT proof.
